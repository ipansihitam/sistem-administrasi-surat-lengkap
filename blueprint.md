I have updated the `form-kelahiran/page.js` and `form-kelahiran/actions.js` files to include a formatted 'Nomor Surat' input. The new input field ensures the number follows the required `474.1/.../.../...` structure, and the data is processed and saved correctly.
I have also applied the same formatting to the `form-kematian/page.js` and `form-perpindahan-wni/page.js` files, ensuring that all letter types have a consistent 'Nomor Surat' format. The corresponding server actions (`form-kematian/actions.js` and `form-perpindahan-wni/actions.js`) have also been updated to handle the new format.
